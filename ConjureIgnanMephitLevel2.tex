You are able to transform a written message of any length into a beautiful scroll. All creatures within range that can see the scroll must make a wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the spell ends.

While the creature is charmed by you, they cannot take their eyes off the scroll and cannot willingly move away from the scroll. Also, the targets can make a wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, they are no longer charmed.
